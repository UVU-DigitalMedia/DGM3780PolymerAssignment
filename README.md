# DGM3780Polymer Assignment
Moving on to front end libraries and frameworks. This repo is all about [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/).

The Polymer library is designed to make it easier and faster for developers to create great, reusable components and elements for the modern web.

#Steps - These have changed!
1. Fork and clone the repo. See [the first assignment](https://github.com/UVU-DigitalMedia/DGM3780-Assign1) for detailed steps.
2.  Create a branch on your local machine.
3. Checkout the branch
4. Complete the assigned coding tasks on the new branch
5. Push Branch to YOUR Github account
6. Submit Pull Request from your new branch

The changes reflect more of a typical real world workflow.

# Assignment
* Add 3 Polymer components from the [Polymer Catalog](https://elements.polymer-project.org/) to index.html
* Create and add your own custom component to index.html. 
  * Two-way data binding is required.
  * Use of a property on your element is required. ( ````<example-element property='value' ></example-element>```` )
* Publish your assignment to [Firebase Hosting](https://www.firebase.com/features.html#features-hosting)


#Tips
- As always, ````npm install```` :sunglasses:
- This assignment has no tests
- [Bower](http://bower.io/) is required. You can find instructions to install it on their website.
- As well as ````npm install```` do a ````bower install```` Bower is a package manager just like npm, but it has a few features that lend it very well to Polymer. I expect in the future, once npm figures out some front-end spicfic issues, Polymer will move to npm. Until then, Bower it is. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
- Inside the repo you will find that there is an index.html file. It currently has 2 custom elements from the Polymer Catalog in it. A Toolbar and a Card. These are for examples! :rocket:
- Here is an **excellent** [YouTube series](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLnpHn493BHGhoGAb2PRKzv4Zw3QoatK-) about Polymer.
- The [Polymer tutorial](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/start/psk/deploy.html) for deploying to Firebase. Very useful!
- Bee :honeybee: Creative! (Yes, I wanted an excuse to use a bee emoji.) The whole idea behind web components is creating useful elements that are reusable. ideally, the element you write could be used in your final project or elsewhere. Or, even cooler, you could publish it to Bower and others could use it in their projects!
- ````npm start```` will spin up a static webserver.
